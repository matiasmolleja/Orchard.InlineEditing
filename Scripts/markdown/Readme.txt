I replicate here the scripts from Orchard.Markdown (Orchard uses Pagedown).
I can't  use the exact same scripts from that module because an issue with zindex.
I need an specific zindex relationship between:
    1. topbar.
    2. markdown dialog.
    3. Modal generated by markdown scripts to show a modal for inserting hyperlinks

This is safe because the scripts from the Orchard.module will be enabled only in the backend and my scripts will be only in the frontend.

The only way I see to achieve this is by modifying z-indexes right in the markdown editor script.
If I develop a custom hyperlink inserting dialog I can come back to the Orchard.Markdown module.
